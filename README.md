## Prolog Lab Programs

The programs are listed with their respected question numbers and associated output snippet in a png file for reference.

#### How to execute these programs
To use these programs you will need to setup a prolog environment.
I have used [**SWI-Prolog**](http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=quickstart) for this.
You can install SWI-Prolog by using this [tutorial](https://wwu-pi.github.io/tutorials/lectures/lsp/010_install_swi_prolog.html).
